# Module 1.1

### Problem Solving

1. Explain as if the listener has never done it before: what are the steps involved in tying a shoelace?

- Place the shoe on foot, or hold the shoe in the same direction as if it were on your foot
- Grab the loose ends of each of the strings at the top of the shoe
- Pulling the strings tight in the air, cross them over one another
- Then, take the end of the string that is on top of the other, the one closest to you, and loop it over the bottom string and through the bottom opening that was created by the 2 crossed strings
- Holding both strings up in the air, pull them both down towards the ground and away from the shoe until the crossed section of the strings are snugly tied on the top of the shoe
- Holding the string in the air that was looped over the other, you can release the other one, taking the top of the string, fold it in half towards the outside of the shoe and hold the string somewhat firmly in the middle of what should now be a loop
- As you continue to hold the string with the loop, grab the top of the other loose string and cross it over the top and around the string with the loop, making sure the tip is now laying on the side of the shoe it originated from
- Now, take and slowly pull the loose string through the bottom openeing of the crossed strings, the side away from you, forming a loop as well
- Be careful not to pull the tip of the string through the openeing
- You should now be able to, while holding each string loops, pull them both down towards the ground and away from the shoe until the looped strings are snugly tied on the top of the shoe
